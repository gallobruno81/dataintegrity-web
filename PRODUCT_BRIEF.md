# DataIntegrity – Product & Service Brief

## Context

DataIntegrity is a boutique professional service, not a large consulting firm and not a mass-market SaaS.

The service is delivered by one senior specialist (occasionally two, at most), with deep expertise in Oracle NSPB, Oracle EPM, and NetSuite integrations.
The product must be designed to support this reality, not an imagined future team.

The goal is to amplify a highly specialized human service, not to replace it.

## What DataIntegrity Is

DataIntegrity provides premium operational support and advisory services for companies running Oracle NSPB and NetSuite.

**Clients come to DataIntegrity because:**
- They want to talk directly to a senior expert
- They value judgment, context, and experience
- They want fewer tickets and fewer surprises, not more process

**This is not:**
- Tiered call-center support
- High-volume ticket handling
- 24/7 coverage
- A scalable “many-agents” operation

It is intentionally small, focused, and human-led.

## Operating Model

- 1 primary operator (the founder)
- Possibly 1 additional trusted collaborator
- Small number of clients
- Long-term relationships
- High trust, low bureaucracy

There are no internal departments, no escalation chains, and no management layers.

The system must assume:
- One person doing support, analysis, communication, and follow-up
- Minimal context switching
- Maximum clarity and speed

## Type of Services Offered

DataIntegrity focuses on:
- NSPB / NetSuite issue diagnosis
- Month-end and quarter-end close assistance
- Workforce, CapEx, and planning logic review
- NetSuite–NSPB reconciliation
- Preventive checks before errors impact close
- Advisory on modeling and functional design decisions

The value is thinking, not just fixing.

## Role of Automation and AI

**Automation exists to:**
- Reduce repetitive manual checks
- Detect issues early (overnight checks, validations)
- Trigger alerts and notifications
- Maintain backups and basic reconciliations
- Support a living knowledge base for recurring issues

**Automation does not replace:**
- Diagnosis
- Functional judgment
- Client conversations
- Decision-making

AI is used to save time and cognitive load, not to simulate a larger company.

## Product Design Principles

The web presence and any future tools should design for:
- A single operator
- Very low operational overhead
- Clear visibility of issues and alerts
- Simple workflows
- Minimal configuration
- No unnecessary abstractions

**Avoid designing:**
- Enterprise-grade SaaS complexity
- Multi-role permission systems
- Heavy workflows meant for teams of 10+
- Features justified only by “future scaling”

**Every feature should answer:**
“Does this help one expert serve clients better with less friction?”
If not, it should not exist.

## Positioning

DataIntegrity is positioned as:
- A boutique, premium service
- Low volume, high depth
- Invisible to clients who want cheap or generic support
- Valuable to clients who want calm, continuity, and expertise

Growth is intentional and controlled, not forced.

## Summary

DataIntegrity is:
- Human-first
- Expert-led
- Small by design
- Supported by automation, not driven by it

The product exists to protect focus, reduce noise, and extend the reach of one expert, not to build a large company infrastructure.
